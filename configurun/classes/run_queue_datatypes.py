Describes all the data types used for communication between the client and the server
Examples:
	- Transmission: A transmission containing the transmission type and the transmission data
	- TransmissionType: The type of transmission (e.g. public key, login, ...), how to handle transmission data
	- TransmissionData: The data of a transmission (e.g. the public key, the login password, ...)

	- clientData: The data of a client (e.g. the client socket, the client public key, the client session key, ...)
	- serverData: The data of a server (e.g. the server socket, the server private key, ...)
